In order to reproduce the results presented in the thesis one should:

1.  Run "FindRelevantCustomersItems.py" to find the most relevant records in the raw datasets. This will create raw datasets call  "'Name_of_dataset'_subset.csv".
2.  Run "DataPrep.py". This will do all the necessary preprocing of the data. Creating files in a subfolder in "Data" called "Preprocessed".
3.  Run "FMModelTraining.py", "DeepFMTraining.py", "X", "X" in order to train all the models presented in the thesis. These models will be saved in a folder called "Models"
4.  Run "Test_DeepFM.py", "", "", "" to get the performance metrics of every model. This will be saved in a txt file in the folder called "outputs"
